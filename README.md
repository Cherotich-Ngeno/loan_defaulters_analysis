### About

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with those people who have the money to invest. In this data analysis project, I have explored the Prosper dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations.
Dataset

The Prosper loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The dataset and data-dictionary can be found on below links.
